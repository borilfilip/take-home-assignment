# Frontend

Put your code in this directory.

Do not worry too much about styling, browser compatibility, or any other corner cases.
Feel free to use existing frameworks, with their default styles, for UI components.

Focus on making the app functional and the code readable and maintainable.

## UX

The app should have 4 pages, all under a separate URL:

- Welcome screen. Should contain two buttons: one to show my past bookings, and one to create a new booking.
- Bookings list. Should display a short summary of past bookings.
- Bookings form. Should display a form to create a new booking.
- Bookings detail. Should show detailed information about a specific booking.

The app should communicate with the backend and handle basic errors.

Good luck!
