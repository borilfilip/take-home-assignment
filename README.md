# Booking app
Home assignment implemented by Filip Bo≈ôil

If you use `npm` instead of `yarn`, simply switch them in the following commands. Syntax is the same.

## Installation
To install all dependencies, run `yarn install`.

## Configuration
If the backend part runs on different URL than http://localhost:8000, change `apiUrl` in src/helpers.ts.

## Run application
To run the application in development mode use `yarn start`. Browser will be automatically opened on address http://localhost:3000.

## Testing
To run all tests, use `yarn test`.
